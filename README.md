YAAC or Yet-Another-Ansible-Cheatsheet

I wanted a simple-ish cheatsheet for Ansible but I wanted it in a printable format.  Hey, call me old school but I like having a paper reference readily available!  I was having trouble finding an already existing artifact to meet my needs, so I created this one.  If you happen upon it and find it useful -- well that makes me happy!

Good luck Ansible-ing!
